# fox-mahjongg
This is a xmahjongg clone using the FOX Toolkit designed to be run on Windows as Linux.
The intention was creating an ad free and no "annoying in game payments" version of mahjongg.

So all the game logic, design, layouts and tiles are still the same one as at xmahjongg.

So here are the credits for all peaple who worked an this, or any version before:

ABOUT XMAHJONGG
---------------
   Xmahjongg is a simple solitaire game. The object is to remove all 144
Mah Jongg tiles from the playing area by matching them two at a time.

   Xmahjongg 2.0 was released in 1990 by Jeff S. Young <jsy@cray.com>. This
version has been completely rewritten by Eddie Kohler <eddietwo@mit.edu>.

   New features in 3.0:
   * Pretty, round-edged, and colorful Mah Jongg tiles.
   * Multiple tile sets.
   * Undo.
   * Hints let you quickly locate possible matches.
   * Solvable boards by default.
   * A clean button for automatically removing certain kinds of tiles.
   * Aesthetics.
   * A count of matches remaining.
   * No fiddling with the X font path.

   Features 2.0 has that are not yet available in 3.0:
   * Tournament mode.
   * Visible board numbers.
   * A "Same" button. (You can click Undo a lot to get the same effect.)
   * Layout configuration mode.

   Please see the man page, `xmahjongg.6', for information on how to play
the game.

   Xmahjongg comes with NO WARRANTY, express or implied, including, but not
limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a
particular purpose.
